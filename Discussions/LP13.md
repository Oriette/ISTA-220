1.	How do you define a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?
Using a paramed array to pass a variable of arguments.

Public static int Example 
Param int[] paramlist
{
}

2.	How do you call a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?
Integer literals
EX: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)(alpha, bravo, charlie, delta.)

3.	Why can’t you use an array to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a mehod?
Because the size is fixed.

4.	How many parameters can a method have?
As many as the machine can handle.

5.	Do parameter arguments have to have the same type?
Yes, they have to be the same. You generally cannot mix types.

6.	What is the difference between a method that takes a parameter argument and one that takes optional arguments?
It has a limited number.

7.	How do you define a method that takes different (and arbitrary) types of arguments?
By using your object.
